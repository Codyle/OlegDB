OlegDB is a ~~single-threaded, non-concurrent~~, transactionless NoSQL database
written by bitter SQL-lovers in a futile attempt to hop on the schemaless trend
before everyone realizes it was a bad move. It is primarily a C library with an
Erlang frontend for communication.

Dependencies
============

* A healthy fear of the end
* Erlang

Installation
============

OlegDB consists of a server written in Erlang and a C library for all of the
heavy lifting. Binaries are in `build/bin/` and the library is in `build/lib/`.
Beam files are also thrown in `build/bin/`.

Currently builds are tested against gcc 4.6 and 4.8.

```bash
# Building everything:
make
# Just the erlang beam files:
make server
# Just the C library:
make liboleg
# Install
sudo make install
```

To run tests:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

To run the erlang server:

```bash
olegdb <db_location>
```

You can optionally specify a port, host or both. But not just a host.

```bash
olegdb <db_location> [host] [port]
```

curl2sudoÂ® install script coming soon.

Documentation
=============

Documentation exists primarily on the [the website](https://olegdb.org/documentation.html),
but also in the [./docs](./docs/) directory.
