Project Oleg
============

Alternate title: "How far can we push a mayonnaise metaphor?"

$ pgrep olegdb | xargs kill
olegdb: No.

OlegDB is a single-threaded, non-concurrent, transactionless NoSQL database
written by bitter SQL-lovers in a futile attempt to hop on the schemaless trend
before everyone realizes it was a bad move.

Dependencies
============

* A healthy fear of the end

Installation
============

OlegDB consists of a server written in Erlang and a C library for all of the
heavy lifting. Binaries are in `build/bin/` and the library is in `build/lib/`.
Beam files are also thrown in `build/bin/`.

```bash
# Building everything:
make
# Just the erlang beam files:
make erlang
# Just the C library:
make liboleg
```

To run tests:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

To run the erlang server:

```bash
./run_server.sh
```
